## Guide for attendees who are starting to learn HTML/CSS.

!> For newbie / beginners please read, understand and follow this starter pack. 
It might take 2-3 hrs or more to finish this. Please try your best to follow all the activities, we know you can do it. :)
!> For attendees who already knows the basics/fundamentals of HTML & CSS, you donâ€™t need to read it all but we recommend to do the final activity - My First Blog Site before attending the study group. 

### Web Browsers

You need a web browser to test your code. Most widely used are [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), and [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads).

### Text editors

HTML &amp; CSS does not require an IDE. You can opt to use one of these as your text editor (or your own choice).

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (all platforms)

!> Warning: Sublime Text shows a popup every hour prompting you to pay if you are using the free version. Please use another editor if you find this annoying.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (all platforms)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (all platforms)
- [Textmate](https://macromates.com/) (OS X only)

For more advanced users, you can opt to use these terminal-based editors:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

## Optional tools

These tools are not required but they make your development environment efficient. It is highly recommended to install them.

### Version Control System

Most popular version control system is [Git](https://git-scm.com/). [Github](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are most popular code hosting sites based on git.
