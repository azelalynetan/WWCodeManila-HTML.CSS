### Understanding the Code

Let’s check and understand the codes from your MyFirstHelloWorld.html. 

HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**.
In web, webpages are made up of **HTML** and **CSS**.

HTML provides the structure, while CSS provides the appearance.
And the structure is composed of elements and tags. 

Going back to our code, each words that starts with ‘<’ and ends with ‘>’ are **tags**.

**HTML tags** are element names surrounded by angle brackets:
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

Example:

In the example above:
* The HTML <a> element (or anchor element) creates a hyperlink to link one page or file to another.
* The opening tag is ‘<a href=”http://shayhowe.com/”>’. Opening tag is used to start an element. 
* The content is ‘Shay Howe’. It is the information displayed in your browser. 
* The closing tag is ‘</a>’. Closing tag is used to end an element. 
* ‘href=”http://shayhowe.com”’ is an example of an attribute ‘href’ with value of ‘http://shayhowe.com’.
