This repository contains resources for HTML and CSS Study Groups.

Website development with `HTML` and `CSS` doesn't need any setup.
You only need a text editor, a web browser and an open mind to get it started!

If you already have it all, then best be on your way.

Start with this presentation below.
And don't forget to do the exercises after each lesson, as they say practice makes it perfect!  


Presentation for Study Groups is available via https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fYJ9X4BpsuRrJKXyYx_9iGAN7xtDTNmx2HlRSkk-1eQ/edit?usp=sharing
