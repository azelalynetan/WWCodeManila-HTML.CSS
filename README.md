**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the 
content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage.

*HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. 
It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies 
that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications.*

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation 
of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should 
be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
